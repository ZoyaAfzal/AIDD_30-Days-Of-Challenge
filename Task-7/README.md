✨ What is Spec-Kit Plus (Short Note)
Spec-Kit Plus is an advanced toolkit for Spec-Driven Development (SDD), where clear specifications are written before any code is generated. 🛠️
 It builds on the original GitHub Spec Kit and provides a structured workflow for creating AI-native applications, including multi-agent systems 🤖.
 In Spec-Kit Plus, specifications, architecture decisions, plans, tasks, and prompt histories are treated as first-class project files, ensuring clarity and consistency 📂.
 The toolkit offers templates, automation scripts, and AI-tool integrations that guide you from writing specs to planning, task generation, and implementation 🧩.
 It is installed via Python 🐍 and initialized with simple CLI commands 💻, making setup easy.
 Overall, Spec-Kit Plus enforces structured development, reducing errors ⚠️ and producing more maintainable, reliable AI-generated software ✅.

🌟 Core Concepts of Spec-Kit Plus

🏛️ Constitution Phase
The Constitution Phase sets the foundational rules for a project 📜 by defining coding standards, testing guidelines, and documentation requirements in a single constitution.md file.
 All future specs and code must follow these rules 🧱, ensuring consistency and quality.
 It acts as the guiding framework for the entire development workflow 🗂️.

🧾 Specify Phase (Specification Phase)
The Specify Phase turns an idea into a clear, structured set of requirements ✍️.
 Using the /sp.specify command, you generate a spec.md file 📄 (plus requirement checklist) describing:
Feature functionality ⚙️


User stories 👤


Acceptance criteria ✅


Edge cases ⚡


Constraints 🚧



🧠 Plan Phase
The Plan Phase translates the specification into a technical roadmap 🗺️.
 Using /sp.plan, it generates files like plan.md and data-model.md 📂 that outline architecture, data models, APIs, and implementation details 🏗️.
 This phase ensures all project rules are followed and technical decisions clarified ⚙️, providing a structured guide for development.

✍️ Tasks Phase
The Tasks Phase breaks the plan into actionable work units 🔨 using /sp.tasks, generating a tasks.md file 📄.
 Each task is small, test-driven, and clearly ordered 🧩, making implementation manageable and traceable ✅.
 This phase ensures all work aligns with the spec and plan, ready for structured development 📌.

⚙️ Implement Phase
The Implement Phase turns the plan and tasks into working code 💻 using /sp.implement.
 It follows a Test-Driven Development workflow:
Write tests first (RED) 🔴


Code to pass them (GREEN) 🟢


Refactor (REFACTOR) ✨

Tasks are executed in order ⏱️, producing source code, tests, and updated progress aligned with the specification and plan 📊.
